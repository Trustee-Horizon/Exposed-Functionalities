# List of Exposed Functionalities and External Resources

| Resource                                     | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Dataspace Connector](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/)    | TRUSTEE IDS connector is based on the 'Dataspace connector' (originally developed by Fraunhofer) reference implementation documented in this web page. The TRUSTEE IDS connector is an extension of this connector.                              |
|  [TRUSTEE IDS Data Provider Connector](https://github.com/Advanced-Dataspaces-VTT/TRUSTEE_IDS_Connector)       | This project includes components for the IDS Connector implementation used in the TRUSTEE project as a gateway, enabling data transfer from IDS data spaces to the TRUSTEE platform. The provided instance features a user interface (UI), a connector component, and a PostgreSQL database. |
| [Gaia-X Digital Clearing House](https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/lab/gxdch/)        | This resource contains technical guidelines for service providers aiming to operate a Gaia-X Digital Clearing House.                    |
| [Super Resolution Use Case Repository](https://gitlab.com/mips_group1/trustee/super-resolution) | Gitlab repository containing relevant code and instructions explaining how a TRUSTEE persona can utilize the weights produced by the FL procedure for the Super Resolution use case. The project available in the repository demonstrates how to convert a trained PyTorch model's weights to and from a CSV format and how to use the Super Resolution class to upscale low-resolution range images, which can then be used as input for applications such as LiDAR SLAM, 3D Object Detection, or Semantic Segmentation.|
